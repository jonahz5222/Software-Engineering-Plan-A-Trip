# Fundrasing

## Options

Due to the overhead costs of most fundraising and the time commitment needed to maybe successful, a profit share at a restaurant would be the best option.

The major options that are downtown that can be scheduled are:

* Moe's Southwest Grill: 20% return
* Midici: 15% return

However, most people go to Moe's on Monday, which is when they have $5 burritos and those dates are all full. Midici is a sit-in restaurant, which means it's highest traffic days are Friday and Saturday, which are all booked. 

Most of the income will be players and their friends therefore Moe's is a better choice since it is cheaper and closer to campus. Having a profit share on a Wednesday could work because players already have time set aside for practice.

## Conclusion

The best option would be a Wednsday in March at Moe's
