##Renting From
Downtown Columbia Enterprise for the time frame of 4/13/18 at 4:30pm to 4/15/18 at 5:00PM

##Number of vehicles
2 or 3. This number has yet to be determined.

##Cost
The per day cost of a vehicle is an average of $45.
For three days of renting two cars the cost would be $270.
For three days of renting three cars the cose would be $405.

###Notes
Due to the cost and the inability to be sure of a number of people I think it would be best to
only have 2 vehicles.
